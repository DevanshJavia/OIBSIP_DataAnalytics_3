Project: Credit Card Fraud Detection using Machine Learning

As part of my data science learning journey, I developed a fraud detection system that identifies suspicious transactions in real-time. The objective was to build an accurate and efficient model capable of distinguishing between legitimate and fraudulent credit card transactions. The project involved key steps such as data preprocessing, handling class imbalance, feature scaling, and applying machine learning algorithms (Random Forest). I also created a dynamic and user-friendly dashboard using Streamlit for real-time fraud 
prediction.

Tools & Technologies Used: 

Python, pandas, scikit-learn, joblib, Streamlit, matplotlib, NumPy

Outcome: 

Achieved over 80% accuracy on a balanced dataset with clear visualization and real-time prediction capability. This project showcases the importance of anomaly detection in financial systems and demonstrates how machine learning can play a critical role in fraud prevention.
